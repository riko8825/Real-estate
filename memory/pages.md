## Individual property pages

**[TODO]** — strategy decision needed:
- (a) Each property gets own page (`/property/pratumnak-pool-villa-3bed`) for SEO
- (b) Modal/lightbox on click (no separate page)
- (c) Just gallery, no individual details

Currently: property cards click → nowhere (no `<a>` wrapping the card, only heart button works)

## Pages roadmap priority

**Phase 1 — fix current placeholder content:**
1. Real photos (5 properties + hero + about + locations)
2. Real testimonials (currently fake)
3. Real listing counts in locations section
4. Real contact info (phone, WhatsApp, LINE, email)

**Phase 2 — backend infrastructure:**
1. Contact form backend (Formspree / Netlify Forms / custom)
2. Favicon, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, OG image
3. GA4 or Plausible analytics

**Phase 3 — content expansion:**
1. `/foreign-buyer-guide` — top-priority SEO page for "buy property thailand" keywords
2. `/why-invest-pattaya` — long-form for "invest pattaya real estate" keywords
3. Area landing pages (Pratumnak, Jomtien, etc.) — long-tail SEO
4. Privacy + Terms (legal requirement)

**Phase 4 — listings system:**
1. Individual property pages (or property detail modal)
2. Filtered category pages (For Sale, For Rent, By Area)
3. **[TODO]** — decide if listings come from CMS, JSON file, or hardcoded HTML

## Legend

- ✅ done — built and live
